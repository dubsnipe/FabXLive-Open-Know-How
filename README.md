# okh-covid19
This is the workshop documentation for the 2020 FabXlive event.

## Description
The COVID-19 pandemic was addressed by a surge of open source projects made by makers around the world. As a result of these decentralized and hasty efforts, users have been overwhelmed by a variety of redundant ideas, as well as a lack of complete and standardized documentation. This will be mainly a documentation workshop on which we will explore the Open Know-How Standard (openknowhow.org/). During the workshop we will learn how to make OKH Manifest files and use it to document and evaluate medical designs for COVID-19 around the web. We will use this information to learn how to effectively discover, compare and select the best projects from a list of devices. As a final activity, we want to discuss the possibility to apply Open Know-How for a wider variety of applications in the maker community.
