## Description
The COVID-19 pandemic was addressed by a surge of open source projects made by makers around the world. As a result of these decentralized and hasty efforts, users have been overwhelmed by a variety of redundant ideas, as well as a lack of complete and standardized documentation. This will be mainly a documentation workshop on which we will explore the Open Know-How Standard (openknowhow.org/). During the workshop we will learn how to make OKH Manifest files and use it to document and evaluate medical designs for COVID-19 around the web. We will use this information to learn how to effectively discover, compare and select the best projects from a list of devices. As a final activity, we want to discuss the possibility to apply Open Know-How for a wider variety of applications in the maker community.

## Workshop Instructions
This workshop will focus on how to effectively document and evaluate redundant projects. We will focus on projects created during the COVID-19 pandemic over the past 3-4 months.

### Choose a project from the list 
Please put your name next to it to avoid repeated projects.
### Create a manifest using the [tool at https://okh.makernet.org/form](https://okh.makernet.org/form).
Fill it out based on the available documentation. Focus on the required fields. We'll describe them during the workshop but you can also check the [documentation](https://app.standardsrepo.com/MakerNetAlliance/OpenKnowHow/src/branch/master/1):

- *Name of the hardware* (please help with some extra description if the makers weren't too original!)
- *Description* (just copy and paste from the documentation page).
- *Keywords*: **we'll focus mostly on these for this workshop**. Please help us by choosing the following: 
    - At least 3 keywords related to its **materials**. For example: fabric, cotton, chiffon, polypropylene, HVAC filter, elastic, nanofiber, plastic, wire, acrylic, MDF, paper towel.
    - At least 3 keywords related to **machines and tools** used to make it. For example: 3D printer, laser cutter, hand made, sewing machine.
    - At least 3 Keywords related to **skills or abilities** required to make. For example: sewing, cutting, drawing, tracing, 3D modelling.
    - 3 keywords that you may use to **describe the project** from what you've read. For example: cheap, simple, intricate, specialized, complex, etc.
- *License*
Check if it's licensed. If not, you can leave this blank. Check https://spdx.org/licenses/ for an identifier.
- *Author of the manifest*
Your name and email will suffice.

### Download the manifest

After you're done making the manifest, press "Download" and save it to your computer. You should have a file named okh.yml (you can rename it if you want).

### Upload the manifest and fill out an evaluation
Go to [this link](https://emiliovelis.com/okh/). Select the manifest file and evaluate the project (input a number from 1 to 10) for the following questions:
- How effective do you believe it is?
- Is it possible to
